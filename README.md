## 📌 What is Data Analysis?

**Data Analysis** is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, support decision-making, and derive actionable insights.

It includes:
- Understanding data structure
- Cleaning missing or inconsistent values
- Performing statistical analysis
- Creating visualizations
- Making data-driven decisions

## 📂 Project Highlights

### 📁 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed deep dives into datasets using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.
- Identified trends, patterns, and correlations.
- Created summary reports and data profiling dashboards.

### 🧹 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
- Converted data types and encoded categorical variables.
- Applied techniques like normalization, scaling, and feature engineering.

### 📈 3. Visualization & Dashboarding
- Used `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly` for insightful plots.
- Created:
  - Heatmaps
  - Histograms
  - Pairplots
  - Time-series visualizations
- Built interactive dashboards using `Streamlit`.

### 📊 4. Statistical Analysis
- Applied descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance).
- Used hypothesis testing and correlation metrics.
- Visualized distribution and probability.

### 🧠 5. Intro to Predictive Modeling
- Built simple regression and classification models.
- Integrated data analysis with scikit-learn pipelines.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy and RMSE.
